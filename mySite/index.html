            <h3 class="error">I am <span class="greeting-name">Félix Almonte</span> </h3>
            <p>As a software developer my experience mainly consists of C++, some javascript and C#. I've also dabbled with commercial game engines such as Gamemaker Studio 1 & 2, which uses a language similar to C++. I was able to release an indie game, which was a retro-platformer called <b>Occultus Command.</b>  Unfortunately, as I was trying to make the game compatible with older PCs, it ended up suffering from low-quality graphics and compressed audio. I am currently making a sequel, simply as a hobby, but this time I'm not limiting the game to a certain size. I am using high-quality art assets and uncompressed wave audio for sfx.</p>
            <p>As far as personal hobbies, I enjoy various grappling sports such as Judo, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and freestyle wrestling. I am not able to practice or compete as much as I'd like due to prior injuries, but I try to stay active as best I can. I also enjoy graphic design, mainly in the style of 90s to early 2000s US comic books, or in the style of gritty manga such as <i>Berserk</i> or <i>Biomega</i>. I've done some commission work consisting of promotional art, webcomic covers and graphic novel art.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy travelling to various states and sightseeing. Last year I travelled to a few amusement parks, a water park, a renaissance fair, some beaches and went hiking to several local parks. </p>
